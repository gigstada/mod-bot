# The AI will use these instructions to generate the modifications.

  Take as many lines as you need.

# Source paths of the files to be processed by the AI. These files (or parts of files if using slices) will be read 
# and sent to the AI.
# Use Python slice syntax at the end of the path to specify a range of lines to read from the file.
src_paths: 
  - path/to/file1.txt
  # - path/to/file2.txt[5:25]

# Glob string to select multiple files based on a pattern. All files matching this pattern will sent to the AI
# unless they are excluded by glob_exclude. This field is optional.
# Note this can be used together with src_paths. The merged result of both fields will be used.
# glob: "*.txt"

# Glob string to exclude from glob pattern. All files matching this pattern will be omitted from the matched paths from
# the glob value. This field does nothing unless glob is specified in the config file.
# glob_exclude: "*.mp3"

# Model to use for the AI. You can use the shortcuts "4" for gpt-4, "3" for gpt-3.5-turbo, and "3l" for gpt-3.5-turbo-16k.
# If no model is specified, gpt-4 will be used by default.
# model: "3l"

# Use the --config file location as the current working directory instead of the CWD of the terminal session.
# This is useful if you have a folder with a config file and some files to update and you want to run the script
# on that folder without `cd`ing into it.

# Does things a little dumber to make it more likely for GPT 3 to understand what's going on. Note that this only
# writes responses to output.txt for now. 
# dumb: true
